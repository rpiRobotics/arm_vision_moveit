# Acquisition.py shows how to acquire images. It relies on
# information provided in the Enumeration example. Also, check out the
# ExceptionHandling and NodeMapInfo examples if you haven't already.
# ExceptionHandling shows the handling of standard and Spinnaker exceptions
# while NodeMapInfo explores retrieving information from various node types.
#
# This example touches on the preparation and cleanup of a camera just before
# and just after the acquisition of images. Image retrieval and conversion,
# grabbing image data, and saving images are all covered as well.
#
# Once comfortable with Acquisition, we suggest checking out
# AcquisitionMultipleCamera, NodeMapCallback, or SaveToAvi.
# AcquisitionMultipleCamera demonstrates simultaneously acquiring images from
# a number of cameras, NodeMapCallback serves as a good introduction to
# programming with callbacks and events, and SaveToAvi exhibits video creation.
